# Rust Friction

> Daily Rust katas focused on language friction points — the places where learning hurts the most, and growth happens.

## About
This repo is my personal grind space for mastering Rust.  
It contains small, focused exercises and code snippets exploring features such as:
- Ownership & Borrowing
- Lifetimes
- Traits & Generics
- Closures
- Smart Pointers
- Concurrency

Think of it as a logbook of pain points and how I worked through them.

## Usage
Clone the repo and run the exercises/tests:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VinEckSie/rust-friction.git
cd rust-friction
cargo test
```

## Why “Rust Friction”?

Because friction creates heat, and heat forges mastery.
Every kata here tackles a feature I wrestled with on my Rust journey.
